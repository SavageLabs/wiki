Any package that is VIP or higher gets access to the FactionsX plugin.</p><p>FactionsX is <strong>modular</strong>, in the context that, it supports <i>addons</i>.

These addons are:</p><ul><li>FGrace-Addon (VIP or higher package)</li><li>FPrinter-Addon (MVP or higher package)</li><li>FTNT-Addon (VIP+ or higher package)</li><li>FTOP-Addon (VIP+ or higher package)</li><li>FWILD-Addon (VIP or higher package)</li></ul><p>Once again, these addons can be accessed by subscribing to a package @ <a href="https://patreon.com/ProSavage">https://patreon.com/ProSavage</a>. As a developer, you can create your own addon for FactionsX. We are currently working on a cloud for any free addons that developers want to add (a bit like the ecloud for PlaceholderAPI). You can find everything you need to create an <a href="https://wiki.savagelabs.net/factions/addons">addon</a> here.</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2>
